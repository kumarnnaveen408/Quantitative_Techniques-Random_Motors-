## Introduction
Imagine you are the Lead Business Analyst at Random Motors, an automobile conglomerate that manufactures cars across a wide range of price points. For the price-conscious consumers, Random Motors manufactures cars under the brand Rocinante. The various models of Rocinante fall in the range of ₹5–10 lakh. The brand is known for cars that are value-for-money and offer very attractive mileage. For the consumers wanting to purchase a luxury car, Random Motors operates under the brand Marengo. Marengo models fall in the range of ₹30–60 lakh. These are sports cars with powerful engines and competitive top speeds.
Suppose your chief engineer has recently come up with two new models: Rocinante36 and Marengo32. He promises that they will outperform the existing competitors in the market.
Rocinante36 is priced at ₹7 lakh and has been designed to deliver a mileage of 22 km/litre and a top speed of 140 km/hr.
Marengo32 is priced at ₹41 lakh and has been designed to deliver a mileage of 15 km/litre and a top speed of 210 km/hr.
The chief engineer has built 20 prototypes of each of the two models to check if the cars are performing as per the desired specifications. If the cars are performing better than expected, then the engineer wants to revise the specifications. However, if they are performing worse than expected, then it is an indication that more investment is needed in the design to improve their performance. The test drive results for the 20 prototypes of each of the two models are provided in the file titled Data Exhibit 1. During the test, the mileage and the top speed is recorded for each of the prototypes. The data will be used for performing hypothesis testing for the claims made on the specifications.
